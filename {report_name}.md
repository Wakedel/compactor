# Report on "Unrestricted Warfare" and China's Strategic Aims

This report provides a detailed analysis of the strategic thinking outlined in "Unrestricted Warfare" and related works by Qiao Liang, focusing on China's ambitions to reshape the global order through non-military means, particularly in the digital and financial realms.

## 1. "Unrestricted Warfare" and its Evolution

In 1999, Wang Xiangsui and Qiao Liang co-authored "La Guerre hors limites" (Unrestricted Warfare), a strategic guide that significantly influenced the understanding of Chinese strategic thought. This book marked a turning point by advocating for a broader approach to warfare that extends beyond traditional military domains. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

The core concept of "Unrestricted Warfare" is that conflict can occur in any domain, including financial, technological, and informational spaces. The updated version of this strategic guide is even more ambitious, suggesting that China should aim to weaken the United States by gaining control over the internet. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang argues that the "battlefield of unrestricted warfare" encompasses all natural spaces and the expanding realm of technology. This perspective broadens the scope of potential conflict zones, emphasizing the importance of non-military instruments in achieving strategic objectives. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

The central tenet is that China should leverage non-military means – financial, legal, and technological – to surpass the United States. This approach involves using these tools strategically to gain an advantage over the US without resorting to traditional warfare.

## 2. The Digital Economy and Information Warfare

Qiao Liang's strategic thinking extends to the digital realm, particularly the internet, which he views as a critical space for modern warfare. In his 2016 book, "L’Arc de l’Empire," he further develops his ideas, portraying information warfare, symbolized by the internet, as a transformative force in the nature of conflict. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

He posits that the internet, despite its origins in the United States, has evolved into an autonomous entity engaged in unrestricted warfare, no longer under the complete control of its country of origin. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang believes that the internet will contribute to the decline of US financial hegemony and the dominance of the dollar by fostering decentralization across the globe. This decentralization challenges the established financial order and creates opportunities for alternative systems to emerge. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

China, not having a hegemonic empire at the beginning of the internet era, can capitalize on this fragmentation to help shape a multipolar world. This involves leveraging the decentralized nature of the internet to promote a more balanced global order. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

The development of the digital economy in China includes the long-term development of the digital yuan as a tool to compete with the US dollar. This digital currency is intended to provide an alternative to the dollar in international transactions. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

China aims to become the leading country in the digital economy, encompassing technical infrastructure, hardware, and content. This agenda includes the digitization of the New Silk Road, integrating digital technologies into this major infrastructure project. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang emphasizes that China and the US are on the same starting line in the era of e-commerce and that the key is who reaches the finish line last. This perspective highlights the competitive nature of the digital economy and the importance of long-term strategic planning.

## 3. Financial Strategies and the Decline of the Dollar

Qiao Liang's analysis extends to the financial realm, where he critiques the US-centric financial system and advocates for alternative strategies. He argues that since the 1970s, the US has prioritized the struggle for capital, leading to a financial capitalism where "capital is king." ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

He contends that the US has used financial economics to subordinate the real economy, causing the world to become dependent on the US dollar. This dependence creates vulnerabilities that China can exploit. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang sees the US as a financial empire reliant on capital and needing to accelerate its efforts to maintain its dominant position. This perceived vulnerability provides an opportunity for China to challenge US financial hegemony. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

He advocates for strengthening anti-dollar policies through financial transactions and payments in alternative currencies. This strategy aims to reduce the world's reliance on the US dollar and promote alternative financial systems. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang predicts that as the digital economy expands, the dollar will retreat from exchange and payment functions, becoming primarily a measure of value, ultimately leading to the end of US dollar hegemony. This shift would fundamentally alter the global financial landscape. ([https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/06/03/la-guerre-hors-limites-un-aggiornamento/])

Qiao Liang suggests that China needs to establish a new credit relationship and system that the Chinese people and the world can accept, creating meta-theories and meta-values for a new human civilization. This involves developing alternative financial and ideological frameworks to challenge the existing Western-dominated systems.
